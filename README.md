## Description

I don't even know if it is a good idea to put this piece of software online. I started creating this software in 2015. As a little explanation, I had no idea on how PHP or even Web technologies work back then. So this piece of software is really just a pile of very bad code.

Beginning 2018 I have started implementing a very basic and at least as bad API to this software. I basically just copied over the Database access code from the main software file and added some mode switching via switch-case statement.

End 2018 I want to pull the Raspberry Pi out of service on which this software is running on. My plan is to still run this software on a Docker Container. Thus I had the chance to improve the software agan a little bit.
